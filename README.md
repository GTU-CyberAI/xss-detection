# XSS Detection Project

This project is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability detection system** using two machine learning models: one Transformer-based and one LSTM-based.

User input is sent to both models.  
If **at least one model** detects a possible XSS attack, the request is **rejected**.

## üîß Project Structure

| File / Folder         | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `server.py`           | The main Flask server. Run it with `python server.py`.                 |
| `config/`             | Stores settings like port, host, and model file names.                 |
| `config/settings.py`  | Contains variables such as `PORT`, `HOST`, and model paths.            |
| `src/main.html`       | The user interface (UI) of the system.                                 |
| `newwnv/`             | Virtual environment folder for **Windows**.                            |
| `requirements.txt`    | Python dependencies used in the virtual environment.                   |
| `tests/test.txt`      | Contains example XSS payloads like `<svg onload=alert('1')>`.          |
| `dmzo_normal.csv`     | Safe inputs. These inputs do **not** contain XSS.                      |
| `xssed.csv`           | Dangerous inputs. These inputs **contain XSS**.                        |
| `tokenizer.pkl`       | A saved tokenizer used to convert input text into sequences for models.|
| `*.ipynb`             | Jupyter notebooks used to train the models.                            |
| `*.h5`                | Trained model files (LSTM and Transformer).                            |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project was developed on **Windows**.
### 0. Installation & Download:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GTU-CyberAI/xss-detection.git

```

### 1. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
newwnv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the server:

```bash
python server.py         # Windows
python3 server.py        # (on Ubuntu, if dependencies are compatible)
```

## How It Works

- User writes input into the webpage.
- The input is sent to the Flask API.
- Two models analyze the input:
  - If **any model** says the input is dangerous ‚Üí system shows warning.
  - If both models say input is clean ‚Üí input is shown in the UI.

---
## Important Functions
- From server.py, function check_xss(): This function is a web endpoint. When a user sends text, this function takes that text and prepares it for the machine learning models. It then uses two different models to predict if the text contains a dangerous XSS attack. Finally, it returns the results from both models.
- From lstm.ipynb  function embedding_matrix(): This part of the code creates a special matrix. First, it trains a Word2Vec model to learn the meaning of words from the text data. Then, it uses these learned meanings to build an embedding_matrix. This matrix helps the main LSTM model understand the relationships between words, which improves its ability to detect attacks.
- From transfromer.ipynb, function TransformerBlock.call(): This function is the main part of the Transformer model. It processes the input data in two steps. First, it uses "attention" (self.att) to focus on the most important words in the text. Second, it uses a simple neural network (self.ffn) to understand these words better. This process helps the model make a good prediction.
 
## Requirements

For necessary versions, install required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- This project uses `Flask`, `TensorFlow`, and `pickle` for backend processing.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the front-end.
- The tokenizer (`tokenizer.pkl`) is essential for preparing the input for both models.
- It works in http://localhost:5000/ . In order to change the port, check the /config/settings.py

Feel free to test the system using the example payloads in `tests/test.txt`.
